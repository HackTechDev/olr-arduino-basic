# OLR-Arduino-basic

Minimalist race game with an LED strip. Connect two switches between common GND and pins A0 and A2 and one led strip ws2812 or ws2813 to GND, + 5V and pin 2 to an arduino Nano

## Alexsolex's version 

- Code formatting as I found the original one quite not easily readable
- Shooting feature

### Shooting feature
Early stage development feature.
To shoot your oponent : just keep button pushed about 1 second. If your opponent is not to far away, its speed will fall to 0 ! 

(known bug : only lag player can shoot on his opponent, but it can change the course of the game ;) )
